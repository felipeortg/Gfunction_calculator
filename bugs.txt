There are some places where the functions break, I am not sure why... maybe I should check this sometime

m1 = 1
m2 = m1
m1L = 6

vecPi = vecPf = vec(0)
I_A_[0;10;10](Ei = 1.8, Ef = 3.85)

vecPi = vec(0)
vecPf = [001]
I_N_[0;10;10](Ei = 3.8, Ef = 3.98 Pf=1.047)
the problem seems to come from around thetak = 3.1(1)
