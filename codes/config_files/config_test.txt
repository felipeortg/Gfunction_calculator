# ONE SPACE before and after (in case of comment) variable_value is needed

# Calculation
# You can either do a mesh or a line
shape mesh # line

# for the mesh you can shift the Ef to avoid errors in IN
shift 0 # 1 for true or 0 to false)

# for the line you can change the slope and intercept
# slop 1
# intercpt 0
